    <h3 class="calibre18">43.  Decorations  (az-Zukhruf)</h3>
    <p class="calibre19">In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">1.  </span>Ha, Meem.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">2.  </span>By the Book that makes things clear.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">3.  </span>We made it an Arabic Quran, so that you may understand.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">4.  </span>And it is with Us, in the Source Book, sublime and wise.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">5.  </span>Shall We hold back the Reminder from you, since you are a transgressing people?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">6.  </span>How many a prophet did We send to the ancients?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">7.  </span>No messenger came to them, but they ridiculed him.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">8.  </span> We destroyed people more powerful than they, and so the example of the ancients has passed away.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">9.  </span>And if you asked them, "Who created the heavens and the earth?" They would say, "The Mighty, the Knower created them."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">10.  </span>He who made the earth a habitat for you, and traced pathways for you on it, that you may be guided.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">11.  </span>He who sends down water from the sky in due proportion; and so We revive thereby a dead land. Thus you will be brought out.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">12.  </span>He Who created all the pairs; and provided you with ships, and animals on which you ride.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">13.  </span>That you may mount their backs, and remember the favor of your Lord as you sit firmly upon them, and say, "Glory be to Him Who placed these at our service; surely we could not have done it by ourselves.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">14.  </span>And surely, to our Lord we will return."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">15.  </span>Yet they turn one of His servants into a part of Him. Man is clearly ungrateful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">16.  </span>Or has He chosen for Himself daughters from what He creates, and favored you with sons?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">17.  </span>Yet when one of them is given news of what he attributes to the Most Gracious, his face darkens, and he suppresses grief.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">18.  </span>"Someone brought up to be beautiful, and unable to help in a fight?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">19.  </span>And they appoint the angels, who are servants to the Most Gracious, as females. Have they witnessed their creation? Their claim will be recorded, and they will be questioned.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">20.  </span>And they say, "Had the Most Gracious willed, we would not have worshiped them." But they have no knowledge of that; they are merely guessing.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">21.  </span>Or have We given them a book prior to this one, to which they adhere?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">22.  </span>But they say, "We found our parents on a course, and we are guided in their footsteps."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">23.  </span>Likewise, We sent no warner before you to any town, but the wealthy among them said, "We found our parents on a course, and we are following in their footsteps."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">24.  </span>He would say, "Even if I bring you better guidance than what you found your parents following?" They would say, "We reject what you are sent with."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">25.  </span>So We wreaked vengeance upon them. Behold, then, what was the fate of those who deny.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">26.  </span>When Abraham said to his father and his people, "I am innocent of what you worship.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">27.  </span>Except for He who created me, for He will guide me."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">28.  </span>And he made it an enduring word in his progeny, so that they may return.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">29.  </span>I gave these and their forefathers some enjoyment, until the truth and a manifest messenger came to them.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">30.  </span>But when the truth came to them, they said, "This is sorcery, and we refuse to believe in it."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">31.  </span>They also said, "If only this Quran was sent down to a man of importance from the two cities."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">32.  </span>Is it they who allocate the mercy of your Lord? It is We who have allocated their livelihood in this life, and We elevated some of them in rank above others, that some of them would take others in service. But your Lord's mercy is better than what they amass.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">33.  </span>Were it not that humanity would become a single community, We would have provided those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious with roofs of silver to their houses, and stairways by which they ascend.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">34.  </span>And doors to their houses, and furnishings on which they recline.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">35.  </span>And decorations. Yet all that is nothing but the stuff of this life. Yet the Hereafter, with your Lord, is for the righteous.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">36.  </span>Whoever shuns the remembrance of the Most Gracious, We assign for him a devil, to be his companion.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">37.  </span>They hinder them from the path, though they think they are guided.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">38.  </span>Until, when He comes to Us, he will say, "If only there were between me and you the distance of the two Easts." What an evil companion!</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">39.  </span>It will not benefit you on that Day, since you did wrong. You are partners in the suffering.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">40.  </span>Can you make the deaf hear, or guide the blind, and him who is in evident error?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">41.  </span>Even if We take you away, We will wreak vengeance upon them.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">42.  </span>Or show you what We have promised them; for We have absolute power over them.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">43.  </span>So adhere to what is revealed to you. You are upon a straight path.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">44.  </span>It is a message for you, and for your people; and you will be questioned.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">45.  </span>Ask those of Our messengers We sent before you: "Did We appoint gods besides the Most Gracious to be worshiped?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">46.  </span>We sent Moses with Our revelations to Pharaoh and his dignitaries. He said, "I am the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">47.  </span>But when he showed them Our signs, they started laughing at them.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">48.  </span>Each sign We showed them was more marvelous than its counterpart. And We afflicted them with the plagues, so that they may repent.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">49.  </span>They said, "O sorcerer, pray to your Lord for us, according to His pledge to you, and then we will be guided."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">50.  </span>But when We lifted the torment from them, they immediately broke their promise.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">51.  </span>Pharaoh proclaimed among his people, saying, "O my people, do I not own the Kingdom of Egypt, and these rivers flow beneath me? Do you not see?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">52.  </span>Am I not better than this miserable wretch, who can barely express himself?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">53.  </span>Why are bracelets of gold not dropped on him, or they angels came with him in procession?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">54.  </span>Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him. They were wicked people.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">55.  </span>And when they provoked Our wrath, We took retribution from them, and We drowned them all.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">56.  </span>Thus We made them a precedent and an example for the others.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">57.  </span>And when the son of Mary was cited as an example, your people opposed.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">58.  </span>They said, "Are our gods better, or he?" They cited him only for argument. In fact, they are a quarrelsome people.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">59.  </span>He was just a servant whom We blessed, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">60.  </span>Had We willed, We would have made of you angels to be successors on earth.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">61.  </span>He is a portent of the Hour, so have no doubt about it, and follow Me. This is a straight way.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">62.  </span>And let not Satan divert you. He is an open enemy to you.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">63.  </span>When Jesus came with the clarifications, he said, "I have come to you with wisdom, and to clarify for you some of what you differ about. So fear Allah, and obey me.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">64.  </span>Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him-this is a straight path."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">65.  </span>But the factions differed among themselves. So woe to the wrongdoers from the suffering of a painful Day.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">66.  </span>Are they only waiting for the Hour to come upon them suddenly, while they are unaware?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">67.  </span>On that Day, friends will be enemies of one another, except for the righteous.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">68.  </span>O My servants, you have nothing to fear on that Day, nor will you grieve.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">69.  </span>Those who believed in Our revelations, and were submissive.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">70.  </span>Enter the Garden, you and your spouses, Joyfully.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">71.  </span>They will be served around with trays of gold, and cups. Therein is whatever the souls desire and delights the eyes. Therein you will stay forever.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">72.  </span>Such is the Garden you are made to inherit, because of what you used to do.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">73.  </span>Therein you will have abundant fruit, from which you eat.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">74.  </span>As for the sinners, they will be in the torment of Hell forever.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">75.  </span>It will never be eased for them. In it, they will be devastated.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">76.  </span>We did them no injustice, but it was they who were the unjust.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">77.  </span>And they will cry, "O Malek, let your Lord finish us off." He will say, "You are staying."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">78.  </span>We have given you the truth, but most of you hate the truth.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">79.  </span>Have they contrived some scheme? We too are contriving.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">80.  </span>Or do they think that We cannot hear their secrets and their conspiracies? Yes indeed, Our messengers are by them, writing down.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">81.  </span>Say, "If the Most Gracious had a son, I would be the first to worship."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">82.  </span>Glorified be the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne, beyond what they describe.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">83.  </span>So leave them to blunder and play, until they encounter their Day which they are promised.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">84.  </span>It is He who is Allah in heaven, and Allah on earth. He is the Wise, the Knower.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">85.  </span>And blessed is He Who has sovereignty over the heavens and the earth and what is between them. He alone has knowledge of the Hour, and to Him you will be returned.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">86.  </span>Those they invoke besides Him are incapable of intercession; only those who testify to the truth and have knowledge.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">87.  </span>And if you asked them, "Who created them?", they would say, "Allah." Why then do they deviate?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">88.  </span>As for his statement: "My Lord, these are a people who do not believe."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">89.  </span>Pardon them, and say, "Peace." They will come to know.</p>
