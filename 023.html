    <h3 class="calibre18">23.  The Believers  (al-Mu'minun)</h3>
    <p class="calibre19">In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">1.  </span>Successful are the believers.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">2.  </span>Those who are humble in their prayers.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">3.  </span>Those who avoid nonsense.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">4.  </span>Those who work for charity.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">5.  </span>Those who safeguard their chastity.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">6.  </span>Except from their spouses, or their dependents-for then they are free from blame.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">7.  </span>But whoever seeks anything beyond that-these are the transgressors.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">8.  </span>Those who are faithful to their trusts and pledges.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">9.  </span>Those who safeguard their prayers.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">10.  </span>These are the inheritors.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">11.  </span>Who will inherit Paradise, wherein they will dwell forever.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">12.  </span>We created man from an extract of clay.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">13.  </span>Then We made him a seed, in a secure repository.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">14.  </span>Then We developed the seed into a clot. Then We developed the clot into a lump. Then We developed the lump into bones. Then We clothed the bones with flesh. Then We produced it into another creature. Most Blessed is Allah, the Best of Creators.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">15.  </span>Then, after that, you will die.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">16.  </span>Then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will be resurrected.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">17.  </span>We created above you seven pathways, and We are never heedless of the creation.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">18.  </span>And We sent down water from the sky in proper quantity, and settled it in the ground, and We are Able to take it away.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">19.  </span>With it We produce for you gardens of palms and vines, yielding abundant fruit for you to eat.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">20.  </span>And a tree springing out of Mount Sinai, producing oil, and seasoning for those who eat.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">21.  </span>And there is a lesson for you in livestock: We give you to drink from what is in their bellies, and you have many benefits in them, and from them you eat.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">22.  </span>And on them, and on the ships, you are transported.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">23.  </span>We sent Noah to his people. He said, "O my people, worship Allah, you have no deity other than Him. Will you not take heed?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">24.  </span>But the notables of his people, who disbelieved, said, "This is nothing but a human like you, who wants to gain superiority over you. Had Allah willed, He would have sent down angels. We never heard of this from our forefathers of old.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">25.  </span>He is nothing but a man possessed. Just ignore him for a while."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">26.  </span>He said, "My Lord, help me, for they have rejected me." </p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">27.  </span>So We inspired him: "Build the Ark under Our observation and by Our inspiration. And when Our decree comes to pass, and the oven boils over, load into it two pairs of every kind, together with your family, except those of them against whom the word has already been pronounced. And do not speak to me concerning those who did wrong; for they are to be drowned."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">28.  </span>Then, when you and those with you are settled in the Ark, say, "Praise be to Allah, who has saved us from the wrongdoing people."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">29.  </span>And say, "My Lord, land me with a blessed landing, as you are the best of transporters."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">30.  </span>Surely in that are signs. We are always testing.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">31.  </span>Then, after them, We established another generation.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">32.  </span>And We sent among them a messenger from themselves: "Serve Allah. You have no god other than Him. Will you not be cautious?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">33.  </span>But the dignitaries of his people, those who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the Hereafter, and We had indulged them in the present life, said, "This is nothing but a human like you; he eats what you eat, and he drinks what you drink.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">34.  </span>If you obey a human being like yourselves, then you will be losers.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">35.  </span>Does he promise you that when you have died and become dust and bones, you will be brought out?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">36.  </span>Farfetched, farfetched is what you are promised.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">37.  </span>There is nothing but our life in this world. We die, and we live, and we are not resurrected.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">38.  </span>He is nothing but a man, making up lies about Allah. We have no faith in him."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">39.  </span>He said, "My Lord, help me, for they have rejected me."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">40.  </span>He said, "Soon they will be filled with regret."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">41.  </span>Then the Blast struck them, justifiably, and We turned them into scum. So away with the wicked people.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">42.  </span>Then, after them, We raised other generations.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">43.  </span>No nation can advance its time, nor can they postpone it.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">44.  </span>Then We sent Our messengers in succession. Every time a messenger came to his community, they called him a liar. So We made them follow one another, and made them history. So away with a people who do not believe.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">45.  </span>Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron, with Our signs and a clear authority.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">46.  </span>To Pharaoh and his nobles, but they turned arrogant. They were oppressive people.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">47.  </span>They said, "Are we to believe in two mortals like us, and their people are our slaves?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">48.  </span>So they called them liars, and thus were among those destroyed.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">49.  </span>And We gave Moses the Scripture, that they may be guided.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">50.  </span>And We made Mary's son and his mother a sign, and We sheltered them on high ground with security and flowing springs.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">51.  </span>O messengers, eat of the good things, and act with integrity. I am aware of what you do.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">52.  </span>This nation of yours is one nation, and I am your Lord, so fear Me.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">53.  </span>But they tore themselves into sects; each party happy with what they have.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">54.  </span>So leave them in their bewilderment until a time.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">55.  </span>Do they assume that, in furnishing them with wealth and children.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">56.  </span>We race to give them the good things? In fact, they have no idea.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">57.  </span>Those who, from awe of their Lord, are fearful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">58.  </span>And those who believe in their Lord's Verses.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">59.  </span>And those who associate no partners with their Lord.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">60.  </span>And those who give what they give, while their hearts quake, knowing that to their Lord they will return.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">61.  </span>It is they who race towards goodness. It is they who will reach it first.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">62.  </span>We never burden any soul beyond its capacity. And with Us is a record that tells the truth, and they will not be wronged.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">63.  </span>But their hearts are puzzled because of this; and they have deeds that do not conform to this, which they continue to perpetrate.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">64.  </span>Until, when We seize the decadent among them with torment, they begin to groan.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">65.  </span>Do not groan today. You will receive no help from Us.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">66.  </span>My Verses were recited to you, but you turned back on your heels.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">67.  </span>Arrogant towards it-talked nonsense about it-disregarded it.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">68.  </span>Have they not pondered the Word? Or has there come to them what came not to their forefathers of old?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">69.  </span>Or is it that they did not recognize their messenger, so they are denying him?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">70.  </span>Or do they say, "He is possessed?" In fact, he brought them the truth, but most of them hate the truth.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">71.  </span>If the truth conformed to their desires, the heavens, the earth, and everyone in them would have gone to ruin. In fact, We have given them their message, but they keep avoiding their message.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">72.  </span>Or are you asking them for a payment? The revenue from your Lord is better, and He is the Best of providers.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">73.  </span>You are inviting them to a straight path.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">74.  </span>But those who do not believe in the Hereafter are swerving from the path.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">75.  </span>Even if We had mercy on them, and relieved their problems, they would still blindly persist in their defiance.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">76.  </span>We have already gripped them with suffering, but they did not surrender to their Lord, nor did they humble themselves.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">77.  </span>Until, when We have opened before them a gate of intense agony, at once they will despair.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">78.  </span>It is He who produced for you the hearing, and the eyesight, and the feelings. But little gratitude you show.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">79.  </span>And it is He who multiplied you on earth, and to Him you will be gathered.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">80.  </span>And it is He who gives life and brings death, and to Him is the alternation of night and day. Do you not understand?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">81.  </span>But they say the like of what the ancients said.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">82.  </span>They say, "After we have died, and become dust and bones, will we be resurrected?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">83.  </span>We were promised this before-we and our ancestors-these are nothing but legends of the ancients."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">84.  </span>Say, "To whom does the earth belong, and everyone in it, if you happen to know?" </p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">85.  </span>They will say, "To Allah." Say, "Will you not reflect?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">86.  </span>Say, "Who is the Lord of the seven heavens, and Lord of the Splendid Throne?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">87.  </span>They will say, "To Allah." Say, "Will you not become righteous?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">88.  </span>Say, "In whose hand is the dominion of all things, and He protects and cannot be protected from, if you happen to know?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">89.  </span>They will say, "To Allah." Say, "Then are you bewitched?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">90.  </span>In fact, We have given them the truth, and they are liars.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">91.  </span>Allah has never begotten a son, nor is there any god besides Him. Otherwise, each god would have taken away what it has created, and some of them would have gained supremacy over others. Glory be to Allah, far beyond what they describe.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">92.  </span>The Knower of the hidden and the manifest. He is exalted, far above what they associate.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">93.  </span>Say, "My Lord, if You would show me what they are promised.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">94.  </span>My Lord, do not place me among the wicked people."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">95.  </span>We are surely Able to show you what We promise them.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">96.  </span>Repel evil by what is better. We are aware of what they describe.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">97.  </span>And say, "My Lord, I seek refuge with You from the urgings of the devils.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">98.  </span>And I seek refuge with You, my Lord, lest they become present."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">99.  </span>Until, when death comes to one of them, he says, "My Lord, send me back.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">100.  </span>That I may do right in what I have neglected." By no means! It is just a word that he utters. And behind them is a barrier, until the Day they are resurrected.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">101.  </span>When the Horn is blown, no relations between them will exist on that Day, and they will not ask after one another.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">102.  </span>Those whose scales are heavy-those are the successful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">103.  </span>But those whose scales are light-those are they who have lost their souls; in Hell they will dwell forever.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">104.  </span>The Fire lashes their faces, and therein they grimace.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">105.  </span>"Were not My revelations recited to you, and you kept on rejecting them?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">106.  </span>They will say, "Our Lord, our wretchedness prevailed over us, and we were a people astray.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">107.  </span>Our Lord! Bring us out of this. If we ever returned, we would truly be evil."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">108.  </span>He will say, "Be despised therein, and do not speak to Me.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">109.  </span>There was a group of My servants who would say, `Our Lord, we have believed, so forgive us, and have mercy on us; You are the Best of the merciful.'</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">110.  </span>But you made then a target of ridicule, until they made you forget My remembrance; and you used to laugh at them.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">111.  </span>Today, I have rewarded them for their endurance. They are the ones who are the triumphant."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">112.  </span>He will say, "How many years did you remain on earth?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">113.  </span>They will say, "We remained a day, or part of a day; but ask those who keep count."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">114.  </span>He will say, "You remained only for a little while, if you only knew.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">115.  </span>Did you think that We created you in vain, and that to Us you will not be returned?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">116.  </span>So Exalted is Allah, the Ruler, the Real. There is no god except He, the Lord of the Noble Throne.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">117.  </span>Whoever invokes another god besides Allah-he has no proof thereof-his reckoning rests with his Lord. The disbelievers will not succeed.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">118.  </span>And say, "My Lord, forgive and have mercy, for You are the Best of the merciful."</p>
