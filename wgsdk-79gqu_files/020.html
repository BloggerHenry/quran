    <h3 class="calibre18">20.  Ta-Ha  (Ta-Ha)</h3>
    <p class="calibre19">In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">1.  </span>Ta, Ha.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">2.  </span>We did not reveal the Quran to you to make you suffer.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">3.  </span>But only as a reminder for him who fears.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">4.  </span>A revelation from He who created the earth and the high heavens.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">5.  </span>The Most Merciful; on the Throne He settled.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">6.  </span>To Him belongs everything in the heavens and the earth, and everything between them, and everything beneath the soil.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">7.  </span>If you speak aloud-He knows the secret, and the most hidden.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">8.  </span>Allah, there is no god but He, His are the Most Beautiful Names. </p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">9.  </span>Has the story of Moses reached you?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">10.  </span>When he saw a fire, he said to his family, "Stay; I have noticed a fire; Perhaps I can bring you a torch therefrom, or find some guidance by the fire."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">11.  </span>Then, when he reached it, he was called, "O Moses.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">12.  </span>I-I am your Lord. Take off your shoes. You are in the sacred valley of Tuwa.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">13.  </span>I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">14.  </span>I-I am Allah. There is no God but I. So serve Me, and practice the prayer for My remembrance.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">15.  </span>The Hour is coming-but I keep it almost hidden-so that each soul will be paid for what it endeavors.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">16.  </span>And do not let him who denies it and follows his desire turn you away from it, lest you fall.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">17.  </span>And what is that in your right-hand, O Moses?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">18.  </span>He said, "This is my staff. I lean on it, and herd my sheep with it, and I have other uses for it."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">19.  </span>He said, "Throw it, O Moses."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">20.  </span>So he threw it-thereupon it became a moving serpent.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">21.  </span>He said, "Take hold of it, and do not fear. We will restore it to its original condition.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">22.  </span>And press your hand to your side; it will come out white, without a blemish-another sign.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">23.  </span>That We may show you some of Our greatest signs.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">24.  </span>Go to Pharaoh; He has transgressed."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">25.  </span>He said, "My Lord, put my heart at peace for me.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">26.  </span>And ease my task for me.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">27.  </span>And untie the knot from my tongue.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">28.  </span>So they can understand my speech.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">29.  </span>And appoint an assistant for me, from my family. </p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">30.  </span>Aaron, my brother.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">31.  </span>Strengthen me with him.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">32.  </span>And have him share in my mission.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">33.  </span>That we may glorify You much.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">34.  </span>And remember You much.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">35.  </span>You are always watching over us."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">36.  </span>He said, "You are granted your request, O Moses.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">37.  </span>We had favored you another time.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">38.  </span>When We inspired your mother with the inspiration.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">39.  </span>`Put him in the chest; then cast him into the river. The river will wash him to shore, where an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his will pick him up. And I have bestowed upon you love from Me, so that you may be reared before My eye.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">40.  </span>When your sister walked along, and said, 'Shall I tell you about someone who will take care of him?' So We returned you to your mother, that she may be comforted, and not sorrow. And you killed a person, but We saved you from stress; and We tested you thoroughly. And you stayed years among the people of Median. Then you came back, as ordained, O Moses.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">41.  </span>And I made you for Myself.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">42.  </span>Go, you and your brother, with My signs, and do not neglect My remembrance.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">43.  </span>Go to Pharaoh. He has tyrannized.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">44.  </span>But speak to him nicely. Perhaps he will remember, or have some fear."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">45.  </span>They said, "Lord, we fear he may persecute us, or become violent."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">46.  </span>He said, "Do not fear, I am with you, I hear and I see.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">47.  </span>Approach him and say, `We are the messengers of your Lord; so let the Children of Israel go with us, and do not torment them. We bring you a sign from your Lord, and peace be upon him who follows guidance.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">48.  </span>It was revealed to us that the punishment falls upon him who disbelieves and turns away.'"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">49.  </span>He said, "Who is your Lord, O Moses."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">50.  </span>He said, "Our Lord is He who gave everything its existence, then guided it."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">51.  </span>He said, "What about the first generations?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">52.  </span>He said, "Knowledge thereof is with my Lord, in a Book. My Lord never errs, nor does He forget."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">53.  </span>He who made the earth a habitat for you; and traced in it routes for you; and sent down water from the sky, with which We produce pairs of diverse plants.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">54.  </span>Eat and pasture your livestock. In that are signs for those with understanding.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">55.  </span>From it We created you, and into it We will return you, and from it We will bring you out another time.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">56.  </span>We showed him Our signs, all of them, but he denied and refused.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">57.  </span>He said, "Did you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic, O Moses?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">58.  </span>We will produce for you magic like it; so make an appointment between us and you, which we will not miss-neither us, nor you-in a central place."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">59.  </span>He said, "Your appointment is the day of the festival, so let the people be gathered together at mid-morning."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">60.  </span>Pharaoh turned away, put together his plan, and then came back.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">61.  </span>Moses said to them, "Woe to you. Do not fabricate lies against Allah, or He will destroy you with a punishment. He who invents lies will fail."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">62.  </span>They disagreed among themselves over their affair, and conferred secretly.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">63.  </span>They said, "These two are magicians who want to drive you out of your land with their magic, and to abolish your exemplary way of life.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">64.  </span>So settle your plan, and come as one front. Today, whoever gains the upper hand will succeed."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">65.  </span>They said, "O Moses, either you throw, or we will be the first to throw."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">66.  </span>He said, "You throw." And suddenly, their ropes and sticks appeared to him, because of their magic, to be crawling swiftly.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">67.  </span>So Moses felt apprehensive within himself.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">68.  </span>We said, "Do not be afraid, you are the uppermost.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">69.  </span>Now throw down what is in your right hand-it will swallow what they have crafted. What they have crafted is only a magician's trickery. But the magician will not succeed, no matter what he does."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">70.  </span>And the magicians fell down prostrate. They said, "We have believed in the Lord of Aaron and Moses."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">71.  </span>He said, "Did you believe in him before I have given you permission? He must be your chief, who has taught you magic. I will cut off your hands and your feet on alternate sides, and I will crucify you on the trunks of the palm-trees. Then you will know which of us is more severe in punishment, and more lasting."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">72.  </span>They said, "We will not prefer you to the proofs that have come to us, and Him who created us. So issue whatever judgment you wish to issue. You can only rule in this lowly life.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">73.  </span>We have believed in our Lord, so that He may forgive us our sins, and the magic you have compelled us to practice. Allah is Better, and more Lasting."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">74.  </span>Whoever comes to his Lord guilty, for him is Hell, where he neither dies nor lives.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">75.  </span>But whoever comes to Him a believer, having worked righteousness-these will have the highest ranks.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">76.  </span>The Gardens of Perpetuity, beneath which rivers flow, dwelling therein forever. That is the reward for him who purifies himself.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">77.  </span>And We inspired Moses: "Travel by night with My servants, and strike for them a dry path across the sea, not fearing being overtaken, nor worrying."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">78.  </span>Pharaoh pursued them with his troops, but the sea overwhelmed them, and completely engulfed them.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">79.  </span>Pharaoh misled his people, and did not guide them.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">80.  </span>O Children of Israel! We have delivered you from your enemy, and promised you by the right side of the Mount, and sent down to you manna and quails.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">81.  </span>Eat of the good things We have provided for you, but do not be excessive therein, lest My wrath descends upon you. He upon whom My wrath descends has fallen.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">82.  </span>And I am Forgiving towards him who repents, believes, acts righteously, and then remains guided.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">83.  </span>"And what made you rush ahead of your people, O Moses?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">84.  </span>He said, "They are following in my footsteps; and I hurried on to You, my Lord, that you may be pleased."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">85.  </span>He said, "We have tested your people in your absence, and the Samarian misled them."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">86.  </span>So Moses returned to his people, angry and disappointed. He said, "O my people, did your Lord not promise you a good promise? Was the time too long for you? Or did you want wrath from your Lord to descend upon you, so you broke your promise to me?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">87.  </span>They said, "We did not break our promise to you by our choice, but we were made to carry loads of the people's ornaments, and we cast them in. That was what the Samarian suggested."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">88.  </span>So he produced for them a calf-a mere body which lowed. And they said, "This is your god, and the god of Moses, but he has forgotten."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">89.  </span>Did they not see that it cannot return a word to them, and has no power to harm them or benefit them?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">90.  </span>Aaron had said to them before, "O my people, you are being tested by this. And your Lord is the Merciful, so follow me, and obey my command."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">91.  </span>They said, "We will not give up our devotion to it, until Moses returns to us."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">92.  </span>He said, "O Aaron, what prevented you, when you saw them going astray.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">93.  </span>From following me? Did you disobey my command?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">94.  </span>He said, "Son of my mother, do not seize me by my beard or my head. I feared you would say, `You have caused division among the Children of Israel, and did not regard my word.'"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">95.  </span>He said, "What do you have to say, O Samarian?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">96.  </span>He said, "I saw what they did not see, so I grasped a handful from the Messenger's traces, and I flung it away. Thus my soul prompted me."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">97.  </span>He said, "Begone! Your lot in this life is to say, 'No contact.' And you have an appointment that you will not miss. Now look at your god that you remained devoted to-we will burn it up, and then blow it away into the sea, as powder."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">98.  </span>Surely your god is Allah, the One besides whom there is no other god. He comprehends everything in knowledge.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">99.  </span>Thus We narrate to you reports of times gone by; and We have given you a message from Our Presence. </p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">100.  </span>Whoever turns away from it will carry on the Day of Resurrection a burden.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">101.  </span>Abiding therein forever. And wretched is their burden on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">102.  </span>On the Day when the Trumpet is blown-We will gather the sinners on that Day, blue.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">103.  </span>Murmuring among themselves: "You have lingered only for ten."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">104.  </span>We are fully aware of what they say, when the most exemplary of them in conduct will say, "You have lingered only a day."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">105.  </span>And they ask you about the mountains. Say, "My Lord will crumble them utterly."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">106.  </span>And leave them desolate waste.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">107.  </span>You will see in them neither crookedness, nor deviation."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">108.  </span>On that Day, they will follow the caller, without any deviation. Voices will be hushed before the Merciful, and you will hear nothing but murmur.  </p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">109.  </span>On that Day, intercession will not avail, except for him permitted by the Merciful, and whose words He has approved.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">110.  </span>He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they cannot comprehend Him in their knowledge.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">111.  </span>Faces will be humbled before the Living, the Eternal. Whoever carries injustice will despair.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">112.  </span>But whoever has done righteous deeds, while being a believer-will fear neither injustice, nor grievance.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">113.  </span>Thus We have revealed it an Arabic Quran, and We have diversified the warnings in it, that perhaps they would become righteous, or it may produce a lesson for them.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">114.  </span>Exalted is Allah, the True King. Do not be hasty with the Quran before its inspiration to you is concluded, and say, "My Lord, increase me in knowledge."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">115.  </span>And We covenanted with Adam before, but he forgot, and We found in him no resolve.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">116.  </span>And when We said to the angels, "Bow down to Adam." They bowed down, except for Satan; he refused.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">117.  </span>We said, "O Adam, this is an enemy to you and to your wife. So do not let him make you leave the Garden, for then you will suffer.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">118.  </span>In it you will never go hungry, nor be naked.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">119.  </span>Nor will you be thirsty in it, nor will you swelter."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">120.  </span>But Satan whispered to him. He said, "O Adam, shall I show you the Tree of Immortality, and a kingdom that never decays?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">121.  </span>And so they ate from it; whereupon their bodies became visible to them, and they started covering themselves with the leaves of the Garden. Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord, and fell.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">122.  </span>But then his Lord recalled him, and pardoned him, and guided him.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">123.  </span>He said, "Go down from it, altogether; some of you enemies of some others. But whenever guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance, will not go astray, nor suffer.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">124.  </span>But whoever turns away from My Reminder, for him is a confined life. And We will raise him on the Day of Resurrection blind."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">125.  </span>He will say, "My Lord, why did You raise me blind, though I was seeing?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">126.  </span>He will say, "Just as Our revelations came to you, and you forgot them, today you will be forgotten."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">127.  </span>Thus We recompense him who transgresses and does not believe in the revelations of his Lord. The punishment of the Hereafter is more severe, and more lasting.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">128.  </span>Is it not instructive to them, how many generations before them We destroyed, in whose settlements they walk? Surely in that are signs for people of understanding.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">129.  </span>Were it not for a word that issued from your Lord, the inevitable would have happened, but there is an appointed term.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">130.  </span>So bear patiently what they say, and celebrate the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun, and before its setting. And during the hours of the night glorify Him, and at the borders of the day, that you may be satisfied.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">131.  </span>And do not extend your glance towards what We have given some classes of them to enjoy-the splendor of the life of this world-that We may test them thereby. Your Lord's provision is better, and more lasting.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">132.  </span>And exhort your people to pray, and patiently adhere to it. We ask of you no sustenance, but it is We who sustain you. The good ending is that for righteousness.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">133.  </span>And they say, "Why does he not bring us a miracle from his Lord?" Were they not given enough miracles in the former scriptures?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">134.  </span>Had We destroyed them with a punishment before him, they would have said, "Our Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we would have followed Your revelations before we were humiliated and disgraced."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">135.  </span>Say, "Everybody is waiting, so wait. You will know who the people of the straight path are, and who is rightly-guided.</p>
