    <h3 class="calibre18">4.  Women  (an-Nisa')</h3>
    <p class="calibre19">In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">1.  </span>O people! Fear your Lord, who created you from a single soul, and created from it its mate, and propagated from them many men and women. And revere Allah whom you ask about, and the parents. Surely, Allah is Watchful over you.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">2.  </span>And give orphans their properties, and do not substitute the bad for the good. And do not consume their properties by combining them with yours, for that would be a serious sin.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">3.  </span>If you fear you cannot act fairly towards the orphans-then marry the women you like-two, or three, or four. But if you fear you will not be fair, then one, or what you already have. That makes it more likely that you avoid bias.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">4.  </span>Give women their dowries graciously. But if they willingly forego some of it, then consume it with enjoyment and pleasure.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">5.  </span>Do not give the immature your money which Allah has assigned to you for support. But provide for them from it, and clothe them, and speak to them with kind words.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">6.  </span>Test the orphans until they reach the age of marriage. If you find them to be mature enough, hand over their properties to them. And do not consume it extravagantly or hastily before they grow up. The rich shall not charge any wage, but the poor may charge fairly. When you hand over their properties to them, have it witnessed for them. Allah suffices as a Reckoner.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">7.  </span>Men receive a share of what their parents and relatives leave, and women receive a share of what their parents and relatives leave; be it little or much-a legal share.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">8.  </span>If the distribution is attended by the relatives, and the orphans, and the needy, give them something out of it, and speak to them kindly.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">9.  </span>Those who are concerned about the fate of their weak children, in case they leave them behind, should fear Allah, and speak appropriate words.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">10.  </span>Those who consume the wealth of orphans illicitly consume only fire into their bellies; and they will roast in a Blaze.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">11.  </span>Allah instructs you regarding your children: The male receives the equivalent of the share of two females. If they are daughters, more than two, they get two-thirds of what he leaves. If there is only one, she gets one-half. As for the parents, each gets one-sixth of what he leaves, if he had children. If he had no children, and his parents inherit from him, his mother gets one-third. If he has siblings, his mother gets one-sixth. After fulfilling any bequest and paying off debts. Your parents and your children-you do not know which are closer to you in welfare. This is Allah's Law. Allah is Knowing and Judicious.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">12.  </span>You get one-half of what your wives leave behind, if they had no children. If they had children, you get one-fourth of what they leave. After fulfilling any bequest and paying off debts. They get one-fourth of what you leave behind, if you have no children. If you have children, they get one-eighth of what you leave. After fulfilling any bequest and paying off debts. If a man or woman leaves neither parents nor children, but has a brother or sister, each of them gets one-sixth. If there are more siblings, they share one-third. After fulfilling any bequest and paying off debts, without any prejudice. This is a will from Allah. Allah is Knowing and Clement.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">13.  </span>These are the bounds set by Allah. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein forever. That is the great attainment.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">14.  </span>But whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, and oversteps His bounds, He will admit him into a Fire, wherein he abides forever, and he will have a shameful punishment.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">15.  </span>Those of your women who commit lewdness, you must have four witnesses against them, from among you. If they testify, confine them to the homes until death claims them, or Allah makes a way for them.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">16.  </span>If two men among you commit it, punish them both. But if they repent and reform, leave them alone. Allah is Redeemer, Full of Mercy.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">17.  </span>Repentance is available from Allah for those who commit evil out of ignorance, and then repent soon after. These-Allah will relent towards them. Allah is Knowing and Wise.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">18.  </span>But repentance is not available for those who commit evils, until when death approaches one of them, he says, "Now I repent," nor for those who die as disbelievers. These-We have prepared for them a painful torment.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">19.  </span>O you who believe! It is not permitted for you to inherit women against their will. And do not coerce them in order to take away some of what you had given them, unless they commit a proven adultery. And live with them in kindness. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike something in which Allah has placed much good.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">20.  </span>If you wish to replace one wife with another, and you have given one of them a fortune, take nothing back from it. Would you take it back fraudulently and sinfully?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">21.  </span>And how can you take it back, when you have been intimate with one another, and they have received from you a solid commitment?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">22.  </span>Do not marry women whom your fathers married, except what is already past. That is improper, indecent, and a bad custom.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">23.  </span>Forbidden for you are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your paternal aunts, your maternal aunts, your brother's daughters, your sister's daughters, your foster-mothers who nursed you, your sisters through nursing, your wives' mothers, and your stepdaughters in your guardianship-born of wives you have gone into-but if you have not gone into them, there is no blame on you. And the wives of your genetic sons, and marrying two sisters simultaneously. Except what is past. Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">24.  </span>And all married women, except those you rightfully possess. This is Allah's decree, binding upon you. Permitted for you are those that lie outside these limits, provided you seek them in legal marriage, with gifts from your property, seeking wedlock, not prostitution. If you wish to enjoy them, then give them their dowry-a legal obligation. You commit no error by agreeing to any change to the dowry. Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">25.  </span>If any of you lack the means to marry free believing women, he may marry one of the believing maids under your control. Allah is well aware of your faith. You are from one another. Marry them with the permission of their guardians, and give them their recompense fairly-to be protected-neither committing adultery, nor taking secret lovers. When they are married, if they commit adultery, their punishment shall be half that of free women. That is for those among you who fear falling into decadence. But to practice self-restraint is better for you. Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">26.  </span>Allah intends to make things clear to you, and to guide you in the ways of those before you, and to redeem you. Allah is Most Knowing, Most Wise.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">27.  </span>Allah intends to redeem you, but those who follow their desires want you to turn away utterly.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">28.  </span>Allah intends to lighten your burden, for the human being was created weak.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">29.  </span>O you who believe! Do not consume each other's wealth illicitly, but trade by mutual consent. And do not kill yourselves, for Allah is Merciful towards you.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">30.  </span>Whoever does that, out of hostility and wrongdoing, We will cast him into a Fire. And that would be easy for Allah.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">31.  </span>If you avoid the worst of what you are forbidden, We will remit your sins, and admit you by a Gate of Honor.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">32.  </span>Do not covet what Allah has given to some of you in preference to others. For men is a share of what they have earned, and for women is a share of what they have earned. And ask Allah of his bounty. Allah has knowledge of everything.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">33.  </span>To everyone We have assigned beneficiaries in what is left by parents and relatives. Those with whom you have made an agreement, give them their share. Allah is Witness over all things.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">34.  </span>Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, as Allah has given some of them an advantage over others, and because they spend out of their wealth. The good women are obedient, guarding what Allah would have them guard. As for those from whom you fear disloyalty, admonish them, and abandon them in their beds, then strike them. But if they obey you, seek no way against them. Allah is Sublime, Great.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">35.  </span>If you fear a breach between the two, appoint an arbiter from his family and an arbiter from her family. If they wish to reconcile, Allah will bring them together. Allah is Knowledgeable, Expert.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">36.  </span>Worship Allah, and ascribe no partners to Him, and be good to the parents, and the relatives, and the orphans, and the poor, and the neighbor next door, and the distant neighbor, and the close associate, and the traveler, and your servants. Allah does not love the arrogant showoff.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">37.  </span>Those who are stingy, and exhort people to stinginess, and conceal what Allah has given them from His bounty. We have prepared for the disbelievers a disgraceful punishment.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">38.  </span>And those who spend their money to be seen by people, and believe neither in Allah nor in the Last Day. Whoever has Satan as a companion-what an evil companion.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">39.  </span>What would they have lost, had they believed in Allah and the Last Day, and gave out of what Allah has provided for them? Allah knows them very well.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">40.  </span>Allah does not commit an atom's weight of injustice; and if there is a good deed, He doubles it, and gives from His Presence a sublime compensation.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">41.  </span>Then how will it be, when We bring a witness from every community, and We bring you as a witness against these?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">42.  </span>On that Day, those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the earth were leveled over them. They will conceal nothing from Allah.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">43.  </span>O you who believe! Do not approach the prayer while you are drunk, so that you know what you say; nor after sexual orgasm-unless you are travelling-until you have bathed. If you are sick, or traveling, or one of you comes from the toilet, or you have had intercourse with women, and cannot find water, find clean sand and wipe your faces and your hands with it. Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">44.  </span>Have you not considered those who were given a share of the Book? They buy error, and wish you would lose the way.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">45.  </span>But Allah knows your enemies best. Allah is sufficient as a Protector, and Allah is sufficient as a Supporter.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">46.  </span>Among the Jews are some who take words out of context, and say, "We hear and we disobey", and "Hear without listening", and "Observe us," twisting with their tongues and slandering the religion. Had they said, "We hear and we obey", and "Listen", and "Give us your attention," it would have been better for them, and more upright. But Allah has cursed them for their disbelief; they do not believe except a little.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">47.  </span>O you who were given the Book! Believe in what We sent down, confirming what you have, before We obliterate faces and turn them inside out, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers. The command of Allah is always done.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">48.  </span>Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives anything less than that to whomever He wills. Whoever associates anything with Allah has devised a monstrous sin.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">49.  </span>Have you not considered those who claim purity for themselves? Rather, Allah purifies whom He wills, and they will not be wronged a whit.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">50.  </span>See how they devise lies against Allah. That alone is an outright sin.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">51.  </span>Have you not considered those who were given a share of the Book? They believe in superstition and evil powers, and say of those who disbelieve, "These are better guided on the way than the believers."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">52.  </span>Those are they whom Allah has cursed. Whomever Allah curses, you will find no savior for him.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">53.  </span>Or do they own a share of the kingdom? Then they would not give people a speck.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">54.  </span>Or do they envy the people for what Allah has given them of His grace? We have given the family of Abraham the Book and wisdom, and We have given them a great kingdom.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">55.  </span>Among them are those who believed in it, and among them are those who held back from it. Hell is a sufficient Inferno.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">56.  </span>Those who reject Our revelations-We will scorch them in a Fire. Every time their skins are cooked, We will replace them with other skins, so they will experience the suffering. Allah is Most Powerful, Most Wise.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">57.  </span>As for those who believe and do good deeds, We will admit them into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. They will have purified spouses therein, and We will admit them into a shady shade.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">58.  </span>Allah instructs you to give back things entrusted to you to their owners. And when you judge between people, judge with justice. Allah's instructions to you are excellent. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">59.  </span>O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. And if you dispute over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is best, and a most excellent determination.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">60.  </span>Have you not observed those who claim that they believe in what was revealed to you, and in what was revealed before you, yet they seek Satanic sources for legislation, in spite of being commanded to reject them? Satan means to mislead them far away.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">61.  </span>And when it is said to them, "Come to what Allah has revealed, and to the Messenger," you see the hypocrites shunning you completely.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">62.  </span>How about when a disaster strikes them because what their hands have put forward, and then they come to you swearing by Allah: "We only intended goodwill and reconciliation"?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">63.  </span>They are those whom Allah knows what is in their hearts. So ignore them, and admonish them, and say to them concerning themselves penetrating words.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">64.  </span>We did not send any messenger except to be obeyed by Allah's leave. Had they, when they wronged themselves, come to you, and prayed for Allah's forgiveness, and the Messenger had prayed for their forgiveness, they would have found Allah Relenting and Merciful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">65.  </span>But no, by your Lord, they will not believe until they call you to arbitrate in their disputes, and then find within themselves no resentment regarding your decisions, and submit themselves completely.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">66.  </span>Had We decreed for them: "Kill yourselves," or "Leave your homes," they would not have done it, except for a few of them. But had they done what they were instructed to do, it would have been better for them, and a firmer confirmation.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">67.  </span>And We would have given them from Our presence a rich compensation.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">68.  </span>And We would have guided them on a straight path.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">69.  </span>Whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger-these are with those whom Allah has blessed-among the prophets, and the sincere, and the martyrs, and the upright. Excellent are those as companions.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">70.  </span>That is the grace from Allah. Allah suffices as Knower.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">71.  </span>O you who believe! Take your precautions, and mobilize in groups, or mobilize altogether.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">72.  </span>Among you is he who lags behind. Then, when a calamity befalls you, he says, "Allah has favored me, that I was not martyred with them."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">73.  </span>But when some bounty from Allah comes to you, he says-as if no affection existed between you and him-"If only I had been with them, I would have achieved a great victory."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">74.  </span>Let those who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter fight in the cause of Allah. Whoever fights in the cause of Allah, and then is killed, or achieves victory, We will grant him a great compensation.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">75.  </span>And why would you not fight in the cause of Allah, and the helpless men, and women, and children, cry out, "Our Lord, deliver us from this town whose people are oppressive, and appoint for us from Your Presence a Protector, and appoint for us from Your Presence a Victor."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">76.  </span>Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah, while those who disbelieve fight in the cause of Evil. So fight the allies of the Devil. Surely the strategy of the Devil is weak.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">77.  </span>Have you not considered those who were told, "Restrain your hands, and perform your prayers, and spend in regular charity"? But when fighting was ordained for them, a faction of them feared the people as Allah is ought to be feared, or even more. And they said, "Our Lord, why did You ordain fighting for us? If only You would postpone it for us for a short while." Say, "The enjoyments of this life are brief, but the Hereafter is better for the righteous, and you will not be wronged one bit."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">78.  </span>Wherever you may be, death will catch up with you, even if you were in fortified towers. When a good fortune comes their way, they say, "This is from Allah." But when a misfortune befalls them, they say, "This is from you." Say, "All is from Allah." So what is the matter with these people, that they hardly understand a thing?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">79.  </span>Whatever good happens to you is from Allah, and whatever bad happens to you is from your own self. We sent you to humanity as a messenger, and Allah is Witness enough.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">80.  </span>Whoever obeys the Messenger is obeying Allah. And whoever turns away-We did not send you as a watcher over them.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">81.  </span>They profess obedience, but when they leave your presence, some of them conspire something contrary to what you said. But Allah writes down what they conspire. So avoid them, and put your trust in Allah. Allah is Guardian enough.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">82.  </span>Do they not ponder the Quran? Had it been from any other than Allah, they would have found in it much discrepancy.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">83.  </span>When some news of security or alarm comes their way, they broadcast it. But had they referred it to the Messenger, and to those in authority among them, those who can draw conclusions from it would have comprehended it. Were it not for Allah's blessing and mercy upon you, you would have followed the Devil, except for a few.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">84.  </span>So fight in the cause of Allah; you are responsible only for yourself. And rouse the believers. Perhaps Allah will restrain the might of those who disbelieve. Allah is Stronger in Might, and More Punishing.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">85.  </span>Whoever intercedes for a good cause has a share in it, and whoever intercedes for an evil cause shares in its burdens. Allah keeps watch over everything.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">86.  </span>When you are greeted with a greeting, respond with a better greeting, or return it. Allah keeps count of everything.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">87.  </span>Allah-there is no god except He. He will gather you to the Day of Resurrection, in which there is no doubt. And who speaks more truly than Allah?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">88.  </span>What is the matter with you, divided into two factions regarding the hypocrites, when Allah Himself has overwhelmed them on account of what they did? Do you want to guide those whom Allah has led astray? Whomever Allah leads astray-you will never find for him a way.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">89.  </span>They would love to see you disbelieve, just as they disbelieve, so you would become equal. So do not befriend any of them, unless they emigrate in the way of Allah. If they turn away, seize them and execute them wherever you may find them; and do not take from among them allies or supporters.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">90.  </span>Except those who join people with whom you have a treaty, or those who come to you reluctant to fight you or fight their own people. Had Allah willed, He would have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. If they withdraw from you, and do not fight you, and offer you peace, then Allah assigns no excuse for you against them.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">91.  </span>You will find others who want security from you, and security from their own people. But whenever they are tempted into civil discord, they plunge into it. So if they do not withdraw from you, nor offer you peace, nor restrain their hands, seize them and execute them wherever you find them. Against these, We have given you clear authorization.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">92.  </span>Never should a believer kill another believer, unless by error. Anyone who kills a believer by error must set free a believing slave, and pay compensation to the victim's family, unless they remit it as charity. If the victim belonged to a people who are hostile to you, but is a believer, then the compensation is to free a believing slave. If he belonged to a people with whom you have a treaty, then compensation should be handed over to his family, and a believing slave set free. Anyone who lacks the means must fast for two consecutive months, by way of repentance to Allah. Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">93.  </span>Whoever kills a believer deliberately, the penalty for him is Hell, where he will remain forever. And Allah will be angry with him, and will curse him, and will prepare for him a terrible punishment. </p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">94.  </span>O you who believe! When you journey in the way of Allah, investigate, and do not say to him who offers you peace, "You are not a believer," aspiring for the goods of this world. With Allah are abundant riches. You yourselves were like this before, and Allah bestowed favor on you; so investigate. Allah is well aware of what you do.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">95.  </span>Not equal are the inactive among the believers-except the disabled-and the strivers in the cause of Allah with their possessions and their persons. Allah prefers the strivers with their possessions and their persons above the inactive, by a degree. But Allah has promised goodness to both. Yet Allah favors the strivers, over the inactive, with a great reward.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">96.  </span>Degrees from Him, and forgiveness, and mercy. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">97.  </span>While the angels are removing the souls of those who have wronged themselves, they will say, "What was the matter with you?" They will say, "We were oppressed in the land." They will say, "Was Allah's earth not vast enough for you to emigrate in it?" These-their refuge is Hell. What a wretched retreat!</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">98.  </span>Except for the weak among men, and women, and children who have no means to act, and no means to find a way out.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">99.  </span>These-Allah may well pardon them. Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">100.  </span>Anyone who emigrates for the sake of Allah will find on earth many places of refuge, and plentitude. Anyone who leaves his home, emigrating to Allah and His Messenger, and then is overtaken by death, his compensation falls on Allah. Allah is Forgiver, Most Merciful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">101.  </span>When you travel in the land, there is no blame on you for shortening the prayers, if you fear that the disbelievers may harm you. The disbelievers are your manifest enemies.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">102.  </span>When you are among them, and you stand to lead them in prayer, let a group of them stand with you, and let them hold their weapons. Then, when they have done their prostrations, let them withdraw to the rear, and let another group, that have not prayed yet, come forward and pray with you; and let them take their precautions and their weapons. Those who disbelieve would like you to neglect your weapons and your equipment, so they can attack you in a single assault. You commit no error, if you are hampered by rain or are sick, by putting down your weapons; but take precautions. Indeed, Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a demeaning punishment.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">103.  </span>When you have completed the prayer, remember Allah, standing, or sitting, or on your sides. And when you feel secure, perform the prayer. The prayer is obligatory for believers at specific times.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">104.  </span>And do not falter in the pursuit of the enemy. If you are aching, they are aching as you are aching, but you expect from Allah what they cannot expect. Allah is Knowledgeable and Wise.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">105.  </span>We have revealed to you the Scripture, with the truth, so that you judge between people in accordance with what Allah has shown you. And do not be an advocate for the traitors.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">106.  </span>And ask Allah for forgiveness. Allah is Forgiver and Merciful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">107.  </span>And do not argue on behalf of those who deceive themselves. Allah does not love the deceitful sinner.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">108.  </span>They hide from the people, but they cannot hide from Allah. He is with them, as they plot by night with words He does not approve. Allah comprehends what they do.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">109.  </span>There you are, arguing on their behalf in the present life, but who will argue with Allah on their behalf on the Day of Resurrection? Or who will be their representative?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">110.  </span>Whoever commits evil, or wrongs his soul, then implores Allah for forgiveness, will find Allah Forgiving and Merciful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">111.  </span>And Whoever earns a sin, earns it against himself. Allah is Aware and Wise.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">112.  </span>And whoever commits a mistake, or a sin, and then blames it on an innocent person, has taken a slander and a clear sin.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">113.  </span>Were it not for Allah's grace towards you, and His mercy, a faction of them would have managed to mislead you. But they only mislead themselves, and they cannot harm you in any way. Allah has revealed to you the Scripture and wisdom, and has taught you what you did not know. Allah's goodness towards you is great.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">114.  </span>There is no good in much of their private counsels, except for him who advocates charity, or kindness, or reconciliation between people. Whoever does that, seeking Allah's approval, We will give him a great compensation.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">115.  </span>Whoever makes a breach with the Messenger, after the guidance has become clear to him, and follows other than the path of the believers, We will direct him in the direction he has chosen, and commit him to Hell-what a terrible destination!</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">116.  </span> Allah will not forgive that partners be associated with Him; but will forgive anything less than that, to whomever He wills. Anyone who ascribes partners to Allah has strayed into far error.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">117.  </span>They invoke in His stead only females. In fact, they invoke none but a rebellious devil.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">118.  </span>Allah has cursed him. And he said, "I will take to myself my due share of Your servants."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">119.  </span>"And I will mislead them, and I will entice them, and I will prompt them to slit the ears of cattle, and I will prompt them to alter the creation of Allah." Whoever takes Satan as a lord, instead of Allah, has surely suffered a profound loss.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">120.  </span>He promises them, and he raises their expectations, but Satan promises them nothing but delusions.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">121.  </span>These-their place is Hell, and they will find no escape from it.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">122.  </span>But as for those who believe and do righteous deeds, We will admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they will abide forever. The promise of Allah is true-and who is more truthful in speech than Allah?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">123.  </span>It is not in accordance with your wishes, nor in accordance with the wishes of the People of the Scripture. Whoever works evil will pay for it, and will not find for himself, besides Allah, any protector or savior.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">124.  </span>But whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, and is a believer-those will enter Paradise, and will not be wronged a whit.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">125.  </span>And who is better in religion than he who submits himself wholly to Allah, and is a doer of good, and follows the faith of Abraham the Monotheist? Allah has chosen Abraham for a friend.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">126.  </span>To Allah belongs what is in the heavens and what is on earth, and Allah encompasses everything.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">127.  </span>They ask you for a ruling about women. Say, "Allah gives you a ruling about them, and so does what is stated to you in the Book about widowed women from whom you withhold what is decreed for them, yet you desire to marry them, and about helpless children: that you should treat the orphans fairly." Whatever good you do, Allah knows it.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">128.  </span>If a woman fears maltreatment or desertion from her husband, there is no fault in them if they reconcile their differences, for reconciliation is best. Souls are prone to avarice; yet if you do what is good, and practice piety-Allah is Cognizant of what you do.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">129.  </span>You will not be able to treat women with equal fairness, no matter how much you desire it. But do not be so biased as to leave another suspended. If you make amends, and act righteously-Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">130.  </span>And if they separate, Allah will enrich each from His abundance. Allah is Bounteous and Wise.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">131.  </span>To Allah belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth. We have instructed those who were given the Book before you, and you, to be conscious of Allah. But if you refuse-to Allah belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth. Allah is in no need, Praiseworthy.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">132.  </span>To Allah belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth. Allah suffices as Manager.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">133.  </span>If He wills, He can do away with you, O people, and bring others. Allah is Able to do that.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">134.  </span>Whoever desires the reward of this world-with Allah is the reward of this world and the next. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">135.  </span>O you who believe! Stand firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even if against yourselves, or your parents, or your relatives. Whether one is rich or poor, Allah takes care of both. So do not follow your desires, lest you swerve. If you deviate, or turn away-then Allah is Aware of what you do.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">136.  </span>O you who believe! Believe in Allah and His messenger, and the Book He sent down to His messenger, and the Book He sent down before. Whoever rejects Allah, His angels, His Books, His messengers, and the Last Day, has strayed far in error.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">137.  </span>Those who believe, then disbelieve, then believe, then disbelieve, then increase in disbelief, Allah will not forgive them, nor will He guide them to a way.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">138.  </span>Inform the hypocrites that they will have a painful punishment.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">139.  </span>Those who ally themselves with the disbelievers instead of the believers. Do they seek glory in them? All glory belongs to Allah.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">140.  </span>He has revealed to you in the Book that when you hear Allah's revelations being rejected, or ridiculed, do not sit with them until they engage in some other subject. Otherwise, you would be like them. Allah will gather the hypocrites and the disbelievers, into Hell, altogether.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">141.  </span>Those who lie in wait for you: if you attain victory from Allah, they say, "Were we not with you?" But if the disbelievers get a turn, they say, "Did we not side with you, and defend you from the believers?" Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection; and Allah will give the disbelievers no means of overcoming the believers.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">142.  </span>The hypocrites try to deceive Allah, but He is deceiving them. And when they stand for prayer, they stand lazily, showing off in front of people, and remembering Allah only a little.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">143.  </span>Wavering in between, neither with these, nor with those. Whomever Allah sends astray, you will never find for him a way.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">144.  </span>O you who believe! Do not befriend disbelievers rather than believers. Do you want to give Allah a clear case against you?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">145.  </span>The hypocrites will be in the lowest level of the Fire, and you will find no helper for them.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">146.  </span>Except those who repent, and reform, and hold fast to Allah, and dedicate their religion to Allah alone. These are with the believers; and Allah will give the believers a great reward.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">147.  </span>What would Allah accomplish by your punishment, if you have given thanks, and have believed? Allah is Appreciative and Cognizant.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">148.  </span>Allah does not like the public uttering of bad language, unless someone was wronged. Allah is Hearing and Knowing.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">149.  </span>If you let a good deed be shown, or conceal it, or pardon an offense-Allah is Pardoning and Capable.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">150.  </span>Those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers, and want to separate between Allah and His messengers, and say, "We believe in some, and reject some," and wish to take a path in between.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">151.  </span>These are the unbelievers, truly. We have prepared for the unbelievers a shameful punishment.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">152.  </span>As for those who believe in Allah and His messengers, and make no distinction between any of them-He will give them their rewards. Allah is Forgiver and Merciful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">153.  </span>The People of the Scripture challenge you to bring down to them a book from the sky. They had asked Moses for something even greater. They said, "Show us Allah plainly." The thunderbolt struck them for their wickedness. Then they took the calf for worship, even after the clear proofs had come to them. Yet We pardoned that, and We gave Moses a clear authority.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">154.  </span>And We raised the Mount above them in accordance with their covenant, and We said to them, "Enter the gate humbly", and We said to them, "Do not violate the Sabbath", and We received from them a solemn pledge.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">155.  </span>But for their violation of their covenant, and their denial of Allah's revelations, and their killing of the prophets unjustly, and their saying, "Our minds are closed." In fact, Allah has sealed them for their disbelief, so they do not believe, except for a few.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">156.  </span>And for their faithlessness, and their saying against Mary a monstrous slander.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">157.  </span>And for their saying, "We have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah." In fact, they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them as if they did. Indeed, those who differ about him are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it, except the following of assumptions. Certainly, they did not kill him.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">158.  </span>Rather, Allah raised him up to Himself. Allah is Mighty and Wise.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">159.  </span>There is none from the People of the Scripture but will believe in him before his death, and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">160.  </span>Due to wrongdoing on the part of the Jews, We forbade them good things that used to be lawful for them; and for deterring many from Allah's path.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">161.  </span>And for their taking usury, although they were forbidden it; and for their consuming people's wealth dishonestly. We have prepared for the faithless among them a painful torment.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">162.  </span>But those among them firmly rooted in knowledge, and the believers, believe in what was revealed to you, and in what was revealed before you; and the observers of prayers, and the givers of charity, and the believers in Allah and the Last Day-upon these We will bestow an immense reward.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">163.  </span>We have inspired you, as We had inspired Noah and the prophets after him. And We inspired Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Patriarchs, and Jesus, and Job, and Jonah, and Aaron, and Solomon. And We gave David the Psalms.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">164.  </span>Some messengers We have already told you about, while some messengers We have not told you about. And Allah spoke to Moses directly.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">165.  </span>Messengers delivering good news, and bringing warnings; so that people may have no excuse before Allah after the coming of the messengers. Allah is Powerful and Wise.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">166.  </span>But Allah bears witness to what He revealed to you. He revealed it with His knowledge. And the angels bear witness. Though Allah is a sufficient witness.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">167.  </span>Those who disbelieve and repel from Allah's path have gone far astray.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">168.  </span> Those who disbelieve and transgress; Allah is not about to forgive them, nor will He guide them to any path.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">169.  </span>Except to the path of Hell, where they will dwell forever. And that is easy for Allah.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">170.  </span>O people! The Messenger has come to you with the truth from your Lord, so believe-that is best for you. But if you disbelieve, to Allah belongs everything in the heavens and the earth. Allah is Omniscient and Wise.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">171.  </span>O People of the Scripture! Do not exaggerate in your religion, and do not say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, is the Messenger of Allah, and His Word that He conveyed to Mary, and a Spirit from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers, and do not say, "Three." Refrain-it is better for you. Allah is only one God. Glory be to Him-that He should have a son. To Him belongs everything in the heavens and the earth, and Allah is a sufficient Protector.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">172.  </span>The Messiah does not disdain to be a servant of Allah, nor do the favored angels. Whoever disdains His worship, and is too arrogant-He will round them up to Himself altogether.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">173.  </span>But as for those who believe and do good works, He will pay them their wages in full, and will increase His grace for them. But as for those who disdain and are too proud, He will punish them with an agonizing punishment. And they will find for themselves, apart from Allah, no lord and no savior.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">174.  </span>O people! A proof has come to you from your Lord, and We sent down to you a clear light.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">175.  </span>As for those who believe in Allah, and hold fast to Him, He will admit them into mercy and grace from Him, and will guide them to Himself in a straight path.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">176.  </span>They ask you for a ruling. Say, "Allah gives you a ruling concerning the person who has neither parents nor children." If a man dies, and leaves no children, and he had a sister, she receives one-half of what he leaves. And he inherits from her if she leaves no children. But if there are two sisters, they receive two-thirds of what he leaves. If the siblings are men and women, the male receives the share of two females." Allah makes things clear for you, lest you err. Allah is Aware of everything.</p>
