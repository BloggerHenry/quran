    <h3 class="calibre18">22.  The Pilgrimage  (al-Hajj)</h3>
    <p class="calibre19">In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">1.  </span>O people, be conscious of your Lord. The quaking of the Hour is a tremendous thing.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">2.  </span>On the Day when you will see it: every nursing mother will discard her infant, and every pregnant woman will abort her load, and you will see the people drunk, even though they are not drunk-but the punishment of Allah is severe.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">3.  </span>Among the people is he who argues about Allah without knowledge, and follows every defiant devil.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">4.  </span>It was decreed for him, that whoever follows him-he will misguide him, and lead him to the torment of the Blaze.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">5.  </span>O people! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection-We created you from dust, then from a small drop, then from a clinging clot, then from a lump of flesh, partly developed and partly undeveloped. In order to clarify things for you. And We settle in the wombs whatever We will for a designated term, and then We bring you out as infants, until you reach your full strength. And some of you will pass away, and some of you will be returned to the vilest age, so that he may not know, after having known. And you see the earth still; but when We send down water on it, it vibrates, and swells, and grows all kinds of lovely pairs.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">6.  </span>That is because Allah is the truth, and because He gives life to the dead, and because He is Capable of everything.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">7.  </span>And because the Hour is coming-there is no doubt about it-and because Allah will resurrect those in the graves.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">8.  </span>And among the people is he who argues about Allah without knowledge, or guidance, or an enlightening scripture.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">9.  </span>Turning aside in contempt, to lead away from the path of Allah. He will have humiliation in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection We will make him taste the agony of burning.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">10.  </span>That is for what your hands have advanced, and because Allah is not unjust to the servants.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">11.  </span>And among the people is he who worships Allah on edge. When something good comes his way, he is content with it. But when an ordeal strikes him, he makes a turnaround. He loses this world and the next. That is the obvious loss.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">12.  </span>He invokes, instead of Allah, what can neither harm him nor benefit him. That is the far straying.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">13.  </span>He invokes one whose harm is closer than his benefit. What a miserable master. What a miserable companion.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">14.  </span>Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds into Gardens beneath which rivers flow. Allah does whatever He wills.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">15.  </span>Whoever thinks that Allah will not help him in this life and in the Hereafter-let him turn to heaven, then sever, and see if his cunning eliminates what enrages him.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">16.  </span>Thus We revealed it as clarifying signs, and Allah guides whomever He wills.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">17.  </span>Those who believe, and those who are Jewish, and the Sabeans, and the Christians, and the Zoroastrians, and the Polytheists-Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection. Allah is witness to all things.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">18.  </span>Do you not realize that to Allah prostrates everyone in the heavens and everyone on earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and the animals, and many of the people? But many are justly deserving of punishment. Whomever Allah shames, there is none to honor him. Allah does whatever He wills.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">19.  </span>Here are two adversaries feuding regarding their Lord. As for those who disbelieve, garments of fire will be tailored for them, and scalding water will be poured over their heads.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">20.  </span>Melting their insides and their skins.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">21.  </span>And they will have maces of iron.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">22.  </span>Whenever they try to escape the gloom, they will be driven back to it: "Taste the suffering of burning."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">23.  </span>But Allah will admit those who believe and do good deeds into Gardens beneath which rivers flow. They will be decorated therein with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their garments therein will be of silk.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">24.  </span>They were guided to purity of speech. They were guided to the path of the Most Praised.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">25.  </span>As for those who disbelieve and repel from Allah's path and from the Sacred Mosque-which We have designated for all mankind equally, whether residing therein or passing through-and seek to commit sacrilege therein-We will make him taste of a painful punishment.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">26.  </span>We showed Abraham the location of the House: "Do not associate anything with Me; and purify My House for those who circle around, and those who stand to pray, and those who kneel and prostrate."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">27.  </span>And announce the pilgrimage to humanity. They will come to you on foot, and on every transport. They will come from every distant point.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">28.  </span>That they may witness the benefits for themselves, and celebrate the name of Allah during the appointed days, for providing them with the animal livestock. So eat from it, and feed the unfortunate poor.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">29.  </span>Then let them perform their acts of cleansing, and fulfill their vows, and circle around the Ancient House.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">30.  </span>All that. Whoever venerates the sanctities of Allah-it is good for him with his Lord. All livestock are permitted to you, except what is recited to you. So stay away from the abomination of idols, and stay away from perjury.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">31.  </span>Being true to Allah, without associating anything with Him. Whoever associates anything with Allah-it is as though he has fallen from the sky, and is snatched by the birds, or is swept away by the wind to a distant abyss.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">32.  </span>So it is. Whoever venerates the sacraments of Allah-it is from the piety of the hearts.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">33.  </span>In them are benefits for you until a certain time. Then their place is by the Ancient House.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">34.  </span>We have appointed a rite for every nation, that they may commemorate Allah's name over the livestock He has provided for them. Your God is One God, so to Him submit, and announce good news to the humble.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">35.  </span>Those whose hearts tremble when Allah is mentioned, and those who endure what has befallen them, and those who perform the prayer and spend from what We have provided for them.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">36.  </span>We have made the animal offerings emblems of Allah for you. In them is goodness for you. So pronounce Allah's name upon them as they line up. Then, when they have fallen on their sides, eat of them and feed the contented and the beggar. Thus We have subjected them to you, that you may be thankful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">37.  </span>Neither their flesh, nor their blood, ever reaches Allah. What reaches Him is the righteousness from you. Thus He subdued them to you, that you may glorify Allah for guiding you. And give good news to the charitable.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">38.  </span>Allah defends those who believe. Allah does not love any ungrateful traitor.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">39.  </span>Permission is given to those who are fought against, and Allah is Able to give them victory.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">40.  </span>Those who were unjustly evicted from their homes, merely for saying, "Our Lord is Allah." Were it not that Allah repels people by means of others: monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques-where the name of Allah is mentioned much-would have been demolished. Allah supports whoever supports Him. Allah is Strong and Mighty.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">41.  </span>Those who, when We empower them in the land, observe the prayer, and give regular charity, and command what is right, and forbid what is wrong. To Allah belongs the outcome of events.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">42.  </span>If they deny you-before them the people of Noah, and Aad, and Thamood also denied.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">43.  </span>And the people of Abraham, and the people of Lot.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">44.  </span>And the inhabitants of Median. And Moses was denied. Then I reprieved those who disbelieved, but then I seized them. So how was My rejection?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">45.  </span>How many a town have We destroyed while it was doing wrong? They lie in ruins; with stilled wells, and lofty mansions.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">46.  </span>Have they not journeyed in the land, and had minds to reason with, or ears to listen with? It is not the eyes that go blind, but it is the hearts, within the chests, that go blind.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">47.  </span>And they ask you to hasten the punishment. But Allah never breaks His promise. A day with your Lord is like a thousand years of your count.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">48.  </span>How many a town have I reprieved, although it was unjust? Then I seized it. To Me is the destination.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">49.  </span>Say, "O people, I am only a plain warner to you."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">50.  </span>Those who believe and work righteousness-for them is forgiveness and a generous provision.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">51.  </span>But those who strive against Our revelations-these are the inmates of Hell.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">52.  </span>We never sent a messenger before you, or a prophet, but when he had a desire Satan interfered in his wishes. But Allah nullifies what Satan interjects, and Allah affirms His revelations. Allah is Omniscient and Wise.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">53.  </span>In order to make Satan's suggestions a trial for those whose hearts are diseased, and those whose hearts are hardened. The wrongdoers are in profound discord.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">54.  </span>And so that those endowed with knowledge may know that it is the truth from your Lord, and so believe in it, and their hearts soften to it. Allah guides those who believe to a straight path.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">55.  </span>Those who disbelieve will continue to be hesitant about it, until the Hour comes upon them suddenly, or there comes to them the torment of a desolate Day.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">56.  </span>Sovereignty on that Day belongs to Allah; He will judge between them. Those who believe and do good deeds will be in the Gardens of Bliss.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">57.  </span>But those who disbelieve and reject Our revelations-these will have a humiliating punishment.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">58.  </span>Those who emigrate in Allah's cause, then get killed, or die, Allah will provide them with fine provisions. Allah is the Best of Providers.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">59.  </span>He will admit them an admittance that will please them. Allah is Knowing and Clement.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">60.  </span>That is so! Whoever retaliates similarly to the affliction he was made to suffer, and then he is wronged again, Allah will definitely assist him. Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">61.  </span>That is because Allah merges the night into the day, and He merges the day into the night, and because Allah is Hearing and Seeing.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">62.  </span>That is because Allah is the Reality, and what they invoke besides Him is vanity, and because Allah is the Sublime, the Grand.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">63.  </span>Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the sky, and the land becomes green? Allah is Kind and Aware.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">64.  </span>To Him belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth. Allah is the Rich, the Praised.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">65.  </span>Do you not see that Allah made everything on earth subservient to you? How the ships sail at sea by His command? That He holds up the sky lest it falls on earth-except by His permission? Allah is Gracious towards the people, Most Merciful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">66.  </span>And it is He who gives you life, then makes you die, then revives you. The human being is unappreciative. </p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">67.  </span>For every congregation We have appointed acts of devotion, which they observe. So do not let them dispute with you in this matter. And invite to your Lord; you are upon a straight guidance.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">68.  </span>But if they dispute with you, say, "Allah is fully aware of what you do."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">69.  </span>Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection regarding what you disagree about.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">70.  </span>Do you not know that Allah knows everything in the heavens and the earth? This is in a book. That is easy for Allah.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">71.  </span>Yet they worship, besides Allah, things for which He sent down no warrant, and what they have no knowledge of. There is no savior for the transgressors.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">72.  </span>And when Our Clear Verses are recited to them, you will recognize disgust on the faces of those who disbelieve. They nearly assault those who recite to them Our Verses. Say, "Shall I inform you of something worse than that? The Fire! Allah has promised it to those who disbelieve. And what a wretched outcome!"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">73.  </span>O people! A parable is presented, so listen to it: Those you invoke besides Allah will never create a fly, even if they banded together for that purpose. And if the fly steals anything from them, they cannot recover it from it. Weak are the pursuer and the pursued.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">74.  </span>They do not value Allah as He should be valued. Allah is Strong and Powerful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">75.  </span>Allah chooses messengers from among the angels, and from among the people. Allah is Hearing and Seeing.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">76.  </span>He knows what is before them, and what is behind them. To Allah all matters are referred.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">77.  </span>O you who believe! Kneel, and prostrate, and worship your Lord, and do good deeds, so that you may succeed.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">78.  </span>And strive for Allah, with the striving due to Him. He has chosen you, and has not burdened you in religion-the faith of your father Abraham. It is he who named you Muslims before, and in this. So that the Messenger may be a witness over you, and you may be witnesses over the people. So pray regularly, and give regular charity, and cleave to Allah. He is your Protector. What an excellent Protector, and what an excellent Helper.</p>
