    <h3 class="calibre18">40.  Forgiver  (Ghafir)</h3>
    <p class="calibre19">In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">1.  </span>Ha, Meem.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">2.  </span>The sending down of the Scripture is from Allah the Almighty, the Omniscient.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">3.  </span>Forgiver of sins, Accepter of repentance, Severe in punishment, Bountiful in bounty. There is no god but He. To Him is the ultimate return.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">4.  </span>None argues against Allah's revelations except those who disbelieve. So do not be impressed by their activities in the land.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">5.  </span>Before them the people of Noah rejected the truth, as did the confederates after them. Every community plotted against their messenger, to capture him. And they argued with falsehood, to defeat with it the truth. But I seized them. What a punishment it was!</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">6.  </span>Thus the sentence of your Lord became realized against those who disbelieve, that they are to be inmates of the Fire.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">7.  </span>Those who carry the Throne, and those around it, glorify their Lord with praise, and believe in Him, and ask for forgiveness for those who believe: "Our Lord, You have encompassed everything in mercy and knowledge; so forgive those who repent and follow Your path, and protect them from the agony of the Blaze.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">8.  </span>And admit them, Our Lord, into the Gardens of Eternity, which You have promised them, and the righteous among their parents, and their spouses, and their offspring. You are indeed the Almighty, the Most Wise.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">9.  </span>And shield them from the evil deeds. Whomever You shield from the evil deeds, on that Day, You have had mercy on him. That is the supreme achievement."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">10.  </span>Those who disbelieved will be addressed, "The loathing of Allah is greater than your loathing of yourselves-for you were invited to the faith, but you refused."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">11.  </span>They will say, "Our Lord, you made us die twice, and twice you gave us life. Now we acknowledge our sins. Is there any way out?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">12.  </span>That is because when Allah alone was called upon, you disbelieved; but when others were associated with Him, you believed. Judgment rests with Allah the Sublime, the Majestic.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">13.  </span>It is He who shows you His wonders, and sends down sustenance from the sky for you. But none pays heed except the repentant.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">14.  </span>So call upon Allah, with sincere devotion to Him, even though the disbelievers resent it.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">15.  </span>Exalted in rank, Owner of the Throne. He conveys the Spirit, by His command, upon whomever He wills of His servants, to warn of the Day of Encounter.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">16.  </span>The Day when they will emerge, nothing about them will be concealed from Allah. "To whom does the sovereignty belong today?" "To Allah, the One, the Irresistible."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">17.  </span>On that Day, every soul will be recompensed for what it had earned. There will be no injustice on that Day. Allah is quick to settle accounts.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">18.  </span>And warn them of the Day of Imminence, when the hearts are at the throats, choking them. The evildoers will have no intimate friend, and no intercessor to be obeyed.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">19.  </span>He knows the deceptions of the eyes, and what the hearts conceal. </p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">20.  </span>Allah judges with justice, while those whom they invoke besides Him cannot judge with anything. It is Allah who is the Hearing, the Seeing.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">21.  </span>Have they not travelled through the earth, and seen the consequences for those before them? They were stronger than them, and they left more impact on earth. But Allah seized them for their sins, and they had no defender against Allah.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">22.  </span>That is because their messengers used to come to them with clear proofs, but they disbelieved, so Allah seized them. He is Strong, Severe in retribution.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">23.  </span>We sent Moses with Our signs, and a clear authority.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">24.  </span>To Pharaoh, Hamaan, and Quaroon. But they said, "A lying sorcerer."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">25.  </span>Then, when he came to them with the truth from Us, they said, "Kill the sons of those who have believed with him, and spare their daughters." But the scheming of the unbelievers can only go astray.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">26.  </span>Pharaoh said, "Leave me to kill Moses, and let him appeal to his Lord. I fear he may change your religion, or spread disorder in the land."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">27.  </span>Moses said, "I have sought the protection of my Lord and your Lord, from every tyrant who does not believe in the Day of Account."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">28.  </span>A believing man from Pharaoh's family, who had concealed his faith, said, "Are you going to kill a man for saying, `My Lord is Allah,' and he has brought you clear proofs from your Lord? If he is a liar, his lying will rebound upon him; but if he is truthful, then some of what he promises you will befall you. Allah does not guide the extravagant imposter.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">29.  </span>O my people! Yours is the dominion today, supreme in the land; but who will help us against Allah's might, should it fall upon us?" Pharaoh said, "I do not show you except what I see, and I do not guide you except to the path of prudence."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">30.  </span>The one who had believed said, "O my people, I fear for you the like of the day of the confederates.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">31.  </span>Like the fate of the people of Noah, and Aad, and Thamood, and those after them. Allah wants no injustice for the servants.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">32.  </span>O my people, I fear for you the Day of Calling Out.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">33.  </span>The Day when you will turn and flee, having no defender against Allah. Whomever Allah misguides has no guide."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">34.  </span>Joseph had come to you with clear revelations, but you continued to doubt what he came to you with. Until, when he perished, you said, "Allah will never send a messenger after him." Thus Allah leads astray the outrageous skeptic.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">35.  </span>Those who argue against Allah's revelations, without any proof having come to them-a heinous sin in the sight of Allah, and of those who believe. Thus Allah seals the heart of every proud bully.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">36.  </span>And Pharaoh said, "O Hamaan, build me a tower, that I may reach the pathways.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">37.  </span>The pathways of the heavens, so that I may glance at the God of Moses; though I think he is lying." Thus Pharaoh's evil deeds were made to appear good to him, and he was averted from the path. Pharaoh's guile was only in defeat.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">38.  </span>The one who had believed said, "O my people, follow me, and I will guide you to the path of rectitude."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">39.  </span>"O my people, the life of this world is nothing but fleeting enjoyment, but the Hereafter is the Home of Permanence.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">40.  </span>Whoever commits a sin will be repaid only with its like. But whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, and is a believer-these will enter Paradise, where they will be provided for without account.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">41.  </span>O my people, how is it that I call you to salvation, and you call me to the Fire?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">42.  </span>You call me to reject Allah, and to associate with Him what I have no knowledge of, while I call you to the Mighty Forgiver.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">43.  </span>Without a doubt, what you call me to has no say in this world, or in the Hereafter; and our turning back is to Allah; and the transgressors are the inmates of the Fire.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">44.  </span>You will remember what I am telling you, so I commit my case to Allah. Allah is Observant of the servants."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">45.  </span>So Allah protected him from the evils of their scheming, while a terrible torment besieged Pharaoh's clan.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">46.  </span>The Fire. They will be exposed to it morning and evening. And on the Day the Hour takes place: "Admit the clan of Pharaoh to the most intense agony."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">47.  </span>As they quarrel in the Fire, the weak will say to those who were arrogant, "We were followers of yours; will you then spare us a portion of the Fire?"</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">48.  </span>Those who were arrogant will say, "We are all in it; Allah has judged between the servants."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">49.  </span>And those in the Fire will say to the keepers of Hell, "Call to your Lord to lessen our suffering for one day."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">50.  </span>They will say, "Did not your messengers come to you with clear signs?" They will say, "Yes." They will say, "Then pray, but the prayers of the disbelievers will always be in vain."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">51.  </span>Most surely We will support Our messengers and those who believe, in this life, and on the Day the witnesses arise.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">52.  </span>The Day when their excuses will not profit the wrongdoers, and the curse will be upon them, and they will have the Home of Misery.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">53.  </span>We gave Moses guidance, and made the Children of Israel inherit the Scripture.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">54.  </span>A guide and a reminder for those endowed with reason.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">55.  </span>So be patient. The promise of Allah is true. And ask forgiveness for your sin, and proclaim the praise of your Lord evening and morning.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">56.  </span>Those who dispute regarding Allah's revelations without any authority having come to them-there is nothing in their hearts but the feeling of greatness, which they will never attain. So seek refuge in Allah; for He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">57.  </span>Certainly the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of humanity, but most people do not know.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">58.  </span>Not equal are the blind and the seeing. Nor are those who believe and work righteousness equal to the sinners. How little you reflect.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">59.  </span>Indeed, the Hour is coming; there is no doubt about it; but most people do not believe.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">60.  </span>Your Lord has said, "Pray to Me, and I will respond to you. But those who are too proud to worship Me will enter Hell forcibly."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">61.  </span>It is Allah Who made the night for you, that you may rest therein; and the day allowing sight. Allah is gracious towards the people, but most people do not give thanks.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">62.  </span>Such is Allah, your Lord, Creator of all things. There is no god except Him; so how could you turn away?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">63.  </span>Thus are turned away those who dispute the signs of Allah.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">64.  </span>It is Allah who made the earth a habitat for you, and the sky a structure. And He designed you, and designed you well; and He provided you with the good things. Such is Allah, your Lord; so Blessed is Allah, Lord of the Worlds.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">65.  </span>He is the Living One. There is no god except He. So pray to Him, devoting your religion to Him. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">66.  </span>Say, "I was prohibited from worshiping those you invoke besides Allah, now that clear revelations have come to me from my Lord; and I was commanded to submit to the Lord of the Worlds."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">67.  </span>It is He who created you from dust, then from a seed, then from an embryo, then He brings you out as an infant, then He lets you reach your maturity, then you become elderly-although some of you die sooner-so that you may reach a predetermined age, so that you may understand.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">68.  </span>It is He who gives life and death; and when He decides on a thing, He just says to it, "Be," and it comes to be.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">69.  </span>Have you not observed those who dispute regarding Allah's revelations, how they have deviated?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">70.  </span>Those who call the Book a lie, and what We sent Our messengers with-they will surely know.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">71.  </span>When the yokes are around their necks, and they will be dragged by the chains.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">72.  </span>Into the boiling water, then in the Fire they will be consumed.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">73.  </span>Then it will be said to them, "Where are those you used to deify?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">74.  </span>Instead of Allah?" They will say, "They have abandoned us. In fact, we were praying to nothing before." Thus Allah sends the disbelievers astray.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">75.  </span>That is because you used to rejoice on earth in other than the truth, and because you used to behave with vanity.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">76.  </span>Enter the gates of Hell, to remain therein forever. What a terrible dwelling for the arrogant.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">77.  </span>So be patient. The promise of Allah is true. Whether We show you some of what We have promised them, or take you to Us, to Us they will be returned.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">78.  </span>We sent messengers before you. Some of them We told you about, and some We did not tell you about. No messenger can bring a miracle except by leave of Allah. Then, when the command of Allah is issued, fair judgment will be passed, and there and then the seekers of vanity will lose.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">79.  </span>Allah is He who created the domestic animals for you-some for you to ride, and some you eat.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">80.  </span>And in them you have other benefits as well, and through them you satisfy your needs. And on them, and on the ships, you are transported.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">81.  </span>And He shows you His signs. So which of Allah's signs will you deny?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">82.  </span>Have they not journeyed through the land, and seen the outcome for those before them? They were more numerous than they, and had greater power and influence in the land. But what they had achieved availed them nothing.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">83.  </span>When their messengers came to them with clear proofs, they rejoiced in the knowledge they had, and the very things they used to ridicule besieged them.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">84.  </span>Then, when they witnessed Our might, they said, "We believe in Allah alone, and we reject what we used to associate with Him."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">85.  </span>But their faith could not help them once they witnessed Our might. This has been Allah's way of dealing with His servants. And there and then the disbelievers lost.</p>
