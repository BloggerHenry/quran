    <h3 class="calibre18">46.  The Dunes  (al-Ahqaf)</h3>
    <p class="calibre19">In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">1.  </span>Ha, Meem.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">2.  </span>The sending down of the Scripture is from Allah, the Honorable, the Wise.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">3.  </span>We did not create the heavens and the earth and what lies between them except with reason, and for a finite period. But the blasphemers continue to ignore the warnings they receive.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">4.  </span>Say, "Have you considered those you worship instead of Allah? Show me which portion of the earth they have created. Or do they own a share of the heavens? Bring me a scripture prior to this one, or some trace of knowledge, if you are truthful."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">5.  </span>Who is more wrong than him who invokes, besides Allah, those who will not answer him until the Day of Resurrection, and are heedless of their prayers?</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">6.  </span>And when humanity is gathered, they will be enemies to them, and will renounce their worship of them.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">7.  </span>When Our revelations are recited to them, plain and clear, those who disbelieve say of the truth when it has come to them, "This is obviously magic."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">8.  </span>Or do they say, "He invented it himself"? Say, "If I invented it myself, there is nothing you can do to protect me from Allah. He knows well what you are engaged in. He is sufficient witness between me and you. He is the Forgiver, the Merciful."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">9.  </span>Say, "I am not different from the other messengers; and I do not know what will be done with me, or with you. I only follow what is inspired in me, and I am only a clear warner."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">10.  </span>Say, "Have you considered? What if it is from Allah and you disbelieve in it? A witness from the Children of Israel testified to its like, and has believed, while you turned arrogant. Allah does not guide the unjust people."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">11.  </span>Those who disbelieve say to those who believe, "If it were anything good, they would not have preceded us to it." And since they were not guided by it, they will say, "This is an ancient lie."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">12.  </span>And before it was the Book of Moses, a model and a mercy. And this is a confirming Book, in the Arabic language, to warn those who do wrong-and good news for the doers of good.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">13.  </span>Those who say, "Our Lord is Allah," then lead a righteous life-they have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">14.  </span>These are the inhabitants of Paradise, where they will dwell forever-a reward for what they used to do.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">15.  </span>We have enjoined upon man kindness to his parents. His mother carried him with difficulty, and delivered him with difficulty. His bearing and weaning takes thirty months. Until, when he has attained his maturity, and has reached forty years, he says, "Lord, enable me to appreciate the blessings You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and to act with righteousness, pleasing You. And improve my children for me. I have sincerely repented to You, and I am of those who have surrendered."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">16.  </span>Those are they from whom We accept the best of their deeds, and We overlook their misdeeds, among the dwellers of Paradise-the promise of truth which they are promised.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">17.  </span>As for him who says to his parents, "Enough of you! Are you promising me that I will be raised up, when generations have passed away before me?" While they cry for Allah's help, "Woe to you! Believe! The promise of Allah is true!" But he says, "These are nothing but tales of the ancients."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">18.  </span>Those are they upon whom the sentence is justified, among the communities that have passed away before them, of jinn and humans. They are truly losers.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">19.  </span>There are degrees for everyone, according to what they have done, and He will repay them for their works in full, and they will not be wronged.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">20.  </span>On the Day when the faithless will be paraded before the Fire: "You have squandered your good in your worldly life, and you took pleasure in them. So today you are being repaid with the torment of shame, because of your unjust arrogance on earth, and because you used to sin."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">21.  </span>And mention the brother of Aad, as he warned his people at the dunes. Warnings have passed away before him, and after him: "Worship none but Allah; I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous Day."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">22.  </span>They said, "Did you come to us to divert us from our gods? Then bring us what you threaten us with, if you are being truthful."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">23.  </span>He said, "The knowledge is only with Allah, and I inform you of what I was sent with; but I see you are an ignorant people."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">24.  </span>Then, when they saw a cloud approaching their valley, they said, "This is a cloud that will bring us rain." "In fact, it is what you were impatient for: a wind in which is grievous suffering."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">25.  </span>It will destroy everything by the command of its Lord. And when the morning came upon them, there was nothing to be seen except their dwellings. Thus We requite the guilty people.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">26.  </span>We had empowered them in the same way as We empowered you; and We gave them the hearing, and the sight, and the minds. But neither their hearing, nor their sight, nor their minds availed them in any way. That is because they disregarded the revelations of Allah; and so they became surrounded by what they used to ridicule.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">27.  </span>We have destroyed many townships around you, and diversified the signs, so that they may return.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">28.  </span>Why then did the idols, whom they worshiped as means of nearness to Allah, not help them? In fact, they abandoned them. It was their lie, a fabrication of their own making.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">29.  </span>Recall when We dispatched towards you a number of jinn, to listen to the Quran. When they came in its presence, they said, "Pay attention!" Then, when it was concluded, they rushed to their people, warning them.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">30.  </span>They said, "O our people, we have heard a Scripture, sent down after Moses, confirming what came before it. It guides to the truth, and to a straight path.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">31.  </span>O our people! Answer the caller to Allah, and believe in Him; and He will forgive you your sins, and will save you from a painful punishment."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">32.  </span>He who does not answer the caller to Allah will not escape on earth, and has no protectors besides Him. Those are in obvious error.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">33.  </span>Do they not realize that Allah, who created the heavens and the earth, and was never tired by creating them, is Able to revive the dead? Yes indeed; He is Capable of everything.</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">34.  </span>On the Day when those who disbelieved are presented to the Fire: "Is this not real?" They will say, "Yes, indeed, by our Lord." He will say, "Then taste the suffering for having disbelieved."</p>
    <p class="calibre19">
      <span class="calibre20">35.  </span>So be patient, as the messengers with resolve were patient, and do not be hasty regarding them. On the Day when they witness what they are promised, it will seem as if they had lasted only for an hour of a day. A proclamation: Will any be destroyed except the sinful people?</p>
